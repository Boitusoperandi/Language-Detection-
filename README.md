# Language-Detection-
langdetect library for Python using Pandas

I used the Language Detection library order to understand what language is being typed. 
Once you type in the language the ouput is in 639-1 Codes. 
Python as of now only has 55 languages I have made a dataset to describe what each code is 
once you enter the text the Spreadsheet (Pandas Spreadsheet) will appear 
You must hit  the keys (CNTRL+F) and place the 639-1 code (which consists of 2 letters) in and it will show you the language


I've attached an excel sheet with 639-1 Codes as well for reference consisting of 2 sheets.
  One has only the Python 639-1 codes (55 of them) 
  the other has all ISO codes
